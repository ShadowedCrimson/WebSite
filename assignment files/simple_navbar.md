# Simple Navbar
Use the techniques demonstrated in the videos to create a simple horizontal navbar
on your webpage. Create a second page for your site that uses the same CSS/Theme and
make the links in the navbar to switch from your main page to the second page.


### Include the following, at a minimum
- Horizontal Navbar
  - Using an unorder list
    - display inline
    - no text decoration
- Consistent theme and navigation between pages
  - Use a common CSS sheet
  - Make sure elements don't 'jump' from page to page
