        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
            I was born and raised in Napoleon, Ohio. So far, I've lived my entire life here outside of long trips to other states. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>
            I've played several sports throughout my life. Soccer and baseball I both enjoyed (Although I was only good at <em>one</em> of those...). 
            But my true passion for thirteen years now has been martial arts. I stand currently at a third-degree black belt. 
            This marks me as being capable of being a teacher of the art now myself if I wish. The style I study is known as <strong>Hapkido</strong>, a Korean art.
        </p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
            I often play video games in my free time. But, I also love to read and write. Fantasy or Sci-Fi mostly, but many genres can catch my eye. 
            I'm currently learning GODOT, a software often used to make indie games.
